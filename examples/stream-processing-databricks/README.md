## Databricks Stream Processing example
This reference architecture shows an end-to-end stream processing pipeline using Azure Databricks. This type of pipeline has four stages: ingest, process, store, and analysis and reporting. For this reference architecture, the pipeline ingests data from two sources, performs a join on related records from each stream, enriches the result, and calculates an average in real time. The results are stored for further analysis.
